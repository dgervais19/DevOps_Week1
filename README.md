* Cloud Platform:
	- AWS

* DevOps Implementations:
	- Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
	- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	- Infrastructure as a platform (IaaP)
	- Infrastructure as a product

## Environments
* Where code runs
* Github, is not an enviroment. But pycharm and computers are environments
* Pycharm:
	- Creates individual virtual environments -> venv folder
	- Robustness

### 3 Main Environments
* Dev Environment
* Testing Environment
* Deployment/Live Environment
