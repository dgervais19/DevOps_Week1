# Intro to DevOps

* Agile Practices:
	- working software, over documentation
	- customer collaboration
	- individual interactions over the process
	- responding

* Internal culture:
	- CI/CD Pipelines
	- Continous Testing
	- Standardized Enviroments
	- Whilest keeping cost low, and  handling peaks and growth

* 4 Pillars of DevOps:
	- Ease of use
	- Flexibility
	- Robustness
	- Cost

A succesful DevOps implementation turns challenges into benefits

* Stages in DevOps Lifecylce:
	- Continuous Integration
	- Continuous Deliver
	- Continuous Deployment
	- Continuous Testing
	- Continuous Monitoring

### DevOps Implementation
* Cloud Platform:
	- AWS
	- GCP
	- Azure

* Infrastructure Architecture:
	- Virtualization
	- Containerization (Docker)

* DevOps Implementations:
	- Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
	- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	- Infrastructure as a platform (IaaP)
	- Infrastructure as a product

## Environments
* Where code runs
* Github, is not an enviroment. But pycharm and computers are environments
* Pycharm:
	- Creates individual virtual environments -> venv folder
	- Robustness

### 3 Main Environments
* Dev Environment
* Testing Environment
* Deployment/Live Environment

## First Virtual Box, Vagrant Dev Environment

This repo is our first virtual environment to create a dev environment.

### Virtual Box
What is it?

### Vangrant

What is it?

Vangrant boxes - pre leaded vagrant files that create virtual machines. Usually just an OS.

* Ubuntu:
    - is an open source OS
    - With GUI it looks like a desktop and works lie one.
    - Headless is basically a terminal, no GUI. (This is the one we will use)
        - faster
        - more secure
        - lighter

* Main commands
    - Vagrant init
    - Vagrant init - search for boxes in https://app.vagrantup.com/
    - Vagrant up
    - Vagrant destroy
